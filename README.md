## Working with Risk and Security in an Architecture Repository - A Working Hypothesis

### Statement no 1
Working with Risk and Security concepts and their attributes in an Architecture Repository will **add** value to any enterprise and their stakeholders, private or public.

### Statement no 2
Working with Risk and Security concepts and their attributes in an Architecture Repository will **only** add value to the Security Architects

### Statement no 3
Working with Risk and Security concepts and their attributes in an Architecture Repository will **not** add value to any enterprise or stakeholder

### Background
Working with security for most of my life and introduced to Enterprise Architecture and Togaf in 2012, an architecture repository seemed to be a possible placeholder for information about risk and security related concerns.
Archimate has concepts that can be used and the Archimate Standard allows the use of attributes.
The genesis of the working hypothesis is a project for security in a shared Norwegian architecture within governmental sector(2015).

### Rationale
The rationale for further research is:
- Improved Stakeholder communication about risk and security
- Improved decision making in Risk assessment
  - Lifecycle management of risk and security issues and concerns
- Usability of OpenFair
  - The Standard
  - The Taxonomy

### Implications


### Approach
- Develop requirement specification using both text and Archimate models
- Archimate models will be in both .archimate and OpenGroup Exchange Format
- Develop both Java code and investigate how to utilize XSLT

### Roadmap:
September 2015: Research repository created and initiated on GitHub  
October 2015: Scope for research completed  
November 2015: v 0.1 of requirements specification completed
