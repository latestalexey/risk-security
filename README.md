# Risk and Security - A Working Hypothesis

## Background
An acrhitecture repository can be placeholder for information about risk and security related concerns.
Archimate has concepts that can be used and the Archimate Standard allows the use of attributes.
The origin of the working hypothesis is a project for security in a shared Norwegian architecture within governmental sector.

## Rationale
The rationale for further research is:
- Stakeholder communication about risk and security
- Wellinformed decision making in Risk assessment
  - Lifecycle management of risk and security issues and concerns
- Usability of OpenFair

## Approach
- Develop requirement specification using both text and Archimate models
- Archimate models will be in both .archimate and OpenGroup Exchange Format
- Develop both Java code and investigate how to utilize XSLT

## Roadmap:
September 2015: Research repository created and initiated on GitHub  
October 2015: Scope for research completed  
November 2015: v 0.1 of requirements specification completed
